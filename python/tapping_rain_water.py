'''Simple Solution '''

'''Find left max and right max- than minimum of these two minus actual height '''


def tapp_rain_water(arr):
    w = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        left_max = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            left_max = max(left_max, arr[j])
        right_max = arr[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            right_max = max(right_max, arr[j])
        w = w + min(left_max, right_max) - arr[i]
    print (w)


tapp_rain_water(l)

'''Optimised Approach'''

''' 
Create two arrays left and right of size n. create a variable max_ = INT_MIN.
Run one loop from start to end. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign left[i] = max_
Update max_ = INT_MIN.
Run another loop from end to start. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign right[i] = max_
Traverse the array from start to end.
The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(a,b) â€“ array[i],(where a = left[i] and b = right[i]) add this value to total amount of water stored
Print the total amount of water stored.
